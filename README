This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5114

adds font icons (glyphs ★♨☢) to programming languages, libraries, and web developer filetypes for: NERDTree, powerline, vim-airline, ctrlp, unite, lightline.vim, vim-startify, vimfiler, and flagship

NOTE: I highly recommend pulling from the repo and managing this plugin with a plugin manager instead of manually!
